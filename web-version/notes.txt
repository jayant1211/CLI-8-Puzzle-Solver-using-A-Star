- [ ] make this retro themed 

working principle:
    1. receive image
    2. transform it to fixed 400*400 size
    3. splice those 9 parts
    4. image container in 9 parts
    5. jumble logic:
        same as from python code
    6. event listeners on arrow key for moving empty space around/surround tiles is better logic
    7. keep stack of movements
