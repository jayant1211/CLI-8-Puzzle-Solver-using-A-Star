working principle:
    1. receive image
    2. transform it to fixed 400*400 size
    3. splice those 9 parts
    4. image container in 9 parts
    5. jumble logic:
        same as from python code
   
    
• Visual indicator for empty tile - done
• Step counter and move history - done
• Animation toggle for tile movement - done
• “Solve” button to run A* - done
• Solvability check (inversion count) - done

CAN DO:
• add keylisteners, use manual keys to move the tile around making it interactive rather just solution
• Performance stats (time, nodes, solution length)
• Performance stats (time, nodes, solution length)
• 8-bit sound effects
• Save puzzle as JSON/image
• Load or replay puzzle state
